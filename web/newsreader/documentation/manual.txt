# Introduction

The newsreader application is an application to read online news.

It downloads news items of your favorite newspapers through RSS-feeds and displays them in a convenient way.

Filters can be set, such that only the news items one is interested in will be shown.

Furthermore, each last visit to a particular newspaper is memorized, and a next visit to the same
newspaper will only show unread news items.


Below will be described how to install and use this application.

A list of required Python packages can be found in /installation/requirements.txt

],

to the dictionary.




- NEWSPAPER2LANGUAGE

Don't forget to register the language of the newly added newspaper




- DEFAULT_PAPER

Set the newspaper that you would like to read by default.





- TESTMODE

This setting is used by developers only, and should be set to False



## Configuration with respect to date and time

- Introduction

Each time a newspaper is visited, the last datetime of the visit will be stored in a cookie
and the next time this newspaper is visited again it will be used in a datetime filter.

So only unread news items will be displayed.

If we visit the same newspaper more than once on a day, news items that have already been read, will
not be shown.

When a cookie is not set, by default all news items of this day are shown.

The next visit will use the cookie, and if the cookie is a day old, news items of yesterday,
since the last datetime of visit will also been shown.

In this way it is guaranteed that news items will not be missed.

When the cookie is older than one day, the filter is set to yesterday meaning that news items older
than yesterday will not be shown, even if they are unread.

A cookie has a lifetime of 15 days


- Settings in constants.py
-- timezone

examples:
    MY_TIMEZONE = 'Europe/Amsterdam'
or
    MY_TIMEZONE = 'Asia/Jakarta'



- Configuration of Firefox


    Browse to Settings -> Privacy & Security

        The following settings should be configured:

            History:
                set to: use custom settings for history

                Properly set: Clear history when Firefox closes.

            Cookies and Site Data: Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed
                don't delete cookie at all or, set exceptions under Manage Exceptions.



- Configuration of Bleachbit

Programs like Bleachbit can remove cookies. Check your settings if you don't want this.




## Configuration of the filters

If the user is not interested in news items of a certain topic, keywords related to the topic
can be stored in a dictionary.

Example.
If a user is not interested in news items related to tennis,
the following keywords can put inside a dictionary:

    tennis
    Roland Garros
    Wimbledon
    US Open
    Federer
    Kim Clijsters

Note, a dictionary filename should conform to the following format:
    dictionary_EN.txt

for another language replace EN, with the country code.



As dictionaries will be updated on a regular basis this might lead to the situation that the filter is set too strict.

For example
If a user is not interested in tennis, but is interested in the Olympics,
it might be he or she is also interested in the Olympic tennis event.

The solution to this is to make use of the exception dictionary.

Given this example, we could add the following terms in the exception dictionary:

    Olympic Games
    Olympics
    Olympic


A news item about the Olympic tennis event will not be filtered with these settings.

Note, an exception dictionary filename should conform to the following format:
    dictionary_EN_exception.txt
