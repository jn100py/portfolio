   1         We start with loading a text locally from disk, with information about France.
   
             We use the browse button to select and load the file frankrijk_info.txt


   2         By pressing 'Next' we open the first section.
    
             A section can also be opened by clicking on its title.


   3         When we want to know which sections contain a certain word, we can enter that word in the search bar.
   
             If we search for 'Nederland', all sections who contain this word can be recognized by an asterisk next to the section title.


   4         We load another text, but this text is located on a server.
    
             First we press the button 'Read text_titles'.

             The filenames of available texts on the server are now being loaded.

             We are interested in the text about Rembrandt.
       
             We select Rembrandt and then press the button 'Read Selected Text'.
