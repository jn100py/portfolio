# introduction

In this demo we use Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest path betwoon two points in a graph.

We use this functionality in a simple routeplanner.

The routeplanner application loads a map from a txt file, and can handle requests to find the shortest path
between two points on a map.
