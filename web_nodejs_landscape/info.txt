- Landscape application

This application is based on the CNCF landscape (see https://landscape.cncf.io)
The original code is open source and can be found here:
    - https://github.com/cncf/landscape
    - https://github.com/cncf/landscapeapp


The application is largely written in Node.js and was modified such that it
can work with project data, instead of company data.

The Netlify component (used for Continuous Deployment) was removed and replaced by a Bash script.
Our version of the landscape runs on NGINX in an Amazon Lightsail environment.
